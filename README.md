# Passwords

This repository contains notes, references, and research related to
passwords, PINs, and authentication practices, maintained as a
technical reference.

The material here focuses on understanding how passwords and PINs are
chosen, generated, and validated, and where real-world systems commonly
fail from a security and usability perspective.

Topics and references include:
- Statistical analysis of PIN and password popularity (e.g., heat maps of common PIN choices)
- Historical context, such as password lists involved in early incidents (e.g., the Morris worm)
- Documentation and examples of password and PIN generators
- Vendor and standards guidance (e.g., Microsoft security advisories)
- Reference implementations and example scripts used for analysis or demonstration

This repository is intended for documentation, study, and research.<br>
It does **not** contain real credentials, secrets, or harvested password
data, and it is **not** intended as an offensive or cracking toolkit.

Out of scope:
- Real credentials, secrets, or leaked password databases
- Tools or instructions intended to bypass authentication systems
- Password cracking or exploitation workflows

This repository is maintained for documentation and research purposes only.
